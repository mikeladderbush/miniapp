My Miniature Catalog Application.

This is a project I am working on in my spare time.
The end goal is to create a program that will bundle a web and desktop application that will allow users to maintain a catalog of miniature models. (e.g. Warhammer 40K)

I'm hoping to polish this more as I become more competent with the skillsets of each tool I use and I hope that if anyone stumbles across this they understand I am working to
reach a level of professional competency one day and this is the stage where I'm learning to crawl.
